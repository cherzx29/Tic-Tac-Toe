HOW TO PLAY:


Starting the Game:
- When you run the game, you’ll be asked to enter a grid size (3 to 10). If an invalid size is entered, it defaults to 3x3.

Choose Game Mode:
- 1 for PvP: Two players take turns as 'X' and 'O'.
- 2 for PvAI: The player is 'X', and the AI is 'O'.

Playing the Game:
- The board is displayed, showing empty spaces, 'X', and 'O'.
Players enter their moves by specifying the row and column they want to mark.
- If you play against the AI, it will make its move after each player turn.
The game checks after each move if there’s a winner or if it’s a draw.

Game End:
- If a player completes a line (row, column, or diagonal), they win, and the        score is updated.
- If the board is full with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

Replay or Exit:
- The scores for each player are displayed.
- You can choose to play again by typing 'y' or 'Y' or exit by typing 'n'.
